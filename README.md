# Codsoft-Task-3-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

This project builds a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world data.  
It includes data preprocessing, class imbalance handling (undersampling), and training using Random Forest.  
Evaluation is done using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix for better fraud identification.  
The model helps in identifying anomalies and enhancing transaction security.
